I recently received a Master's degree from [Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw), National Taiwan University.
In Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications Research Group ([TONIC](http://tonic.ee.ntu.edu.tw)), I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Hung-Yun Hsieh](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=306) on several research topics including security and performance issues on 5G communication standards, wireless virtual reality, and 360° video streaming.

I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 2023. My research interests include 
* video prefetching over traditional/short/360°/volumetric videos, 
* efficient tiling mechanism for 360° videos, 
* resource optimization for streaming service over 5G infrastructure.
