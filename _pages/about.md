I am an ECE Ph.D. student at [Georgia Tech ECE](https://www.ece.gatech.edu), advised by Prof. [Raghupathy Sivakumar](https://siva.ece.gatech.edu).
My research direction focuses on EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) with the ambition to bring BCI into everyday life for everyone on the planet.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) and [Communication Engineering](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw/en/) from National Taiwan University.
I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Hung-Yun Hsieh](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=306) in Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications Research Group ([TONIC](http://tonic.ee.ntu.edu.tw)) on several research topics including security and performance issues on 5G communication standards, wireless virtual reality, and 360Â° video streaming.
